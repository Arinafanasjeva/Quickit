                    My name is Anne Sofie and I am the founder of Quickit.
                    I’ve studied entrepreneurship and design and I like optimisation, which the Idea of Quickit is
                    raised from. <br><br>
                    If we start at the beginning, before Quickit even had a name, we were a bunch of girls who enjoyed
                    meeting up at cafés to chat about all and nothing for hours, as a break from our exams and
                    boyfriends. <br><br>
                    We would buy a café latte and then one more and sometimes we would have wine instead. The only
                    problem we met again and again, were the time we had to wait for the waiter in between our orders
                    and mainly when we wanted to pay the bill and leave. Often the result were that we wouldn’t order
                    the extra café latte or glass of wine, because it simply took to long time.
                    The subject of our conversation then changed into how we could solve this problem and optimize our
                    visits and so the concept began to take shape. The result became a mobile application with a virtual
                    menu, wherefrom you can pick and choose what you’d like to order and then pay right away, so you
                    don’t have to wait as much for the waiter. <br><br>
                    Not only would the concept solve the problem that gave us the idea, but it’s beneficial for so many
                    other reasons. Like during Covid where we need to social distance and the restaurants gets a direct
                    marketing channel to their guests to promote themselves and set up nice deals to fill their tables.
                    <br><br>
                    With my 7 year industry knowledge from being a waiter and manager alongside with my studies, I could
                    then put together the two needs from respectively a business and an user and create a beneficial
                    concept that would make the restaurant experience even better!

                Quickit is created to improve the service in your restaurant. Do not remove it.
                Quickit arose from the need to reduce waiting times during busy times, and has since developed into a
                concept that also benefits the consumer's desire to buy and thus the restaurant's turnover - because it
                has never been easier to order, and Quickit never forgets to ask if the guest wants more.
                <br>At Quickit, we believe that the personal service is still the best - if that is the one you have
                come to
                get. Therefore, we also believe that the composition of the server and the virtual server, ie Quickit,
                is the perfect combination for you who want to accommodate your guests in every conceivable way.
            </p>
            <p>
                We see in all corners of the world that the digital wave has taken hold, and has swept across all
                industries.
                This also applies to the restaurant industry. We are facing a future where not a single second will be
                left to chance, because we want to spend our precious time wisely - and because we have the choice.
                <br>
                Whether your guests want to take advantage of your skilled waiters, or whether they want to sit in their
                own thoughts and order with Quickit, let the choice be theirs - and enjoy it at the same time.

                        service can be significantly streamlined with Quickit as an assistant. We are there to reduce
                        the
                        waiting time for the consumer, and to assist the waiter during the busiest hours.

                        sparingly with its time. That expectation and calculation Quickit will meet. Our vision is to be
                        considered the waiter's assistant - so Quickit will be an indispensable part of your team,
                        helping
